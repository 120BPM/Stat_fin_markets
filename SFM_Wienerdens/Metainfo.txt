Input:      ' dt - delta t
               c - constant
               s - time moment
               a - left limit
               b - right limit
               x0 - initial value of the process'

Output:       Plot of Wiener process simulation and its conditional density.

Example:      'An example is produced for the values: [dt, c, s]=
               [0.01, 2, 150], [a, b, x0] = [90, 110, 50]'
